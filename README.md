### Assignment 2: Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

#### Tasks:

1. Create public repo (10 points): **Done.**

2. Identify tools for mob programming/meetings/recording (20 points): **Done.** We're using Zoom. https://zoom.us/

3. Complete the Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata (70 points):
   1. Add Gilded Rose code to your repo: **Done.** (Note: Team voted to complete grrkata in C#, 19 Feb 2019.)
   2. Mob with your teammates to add unit tests until it is safe to refactor the legacy code. To demonstrate that you worked as a mob, capture video of your session. Upload your video to YouTube. Document the URL of your video in your repo's README file.
   3. Aim for excellent code coverage of the production code; ignore code coverage of the test code. Take a screenshot of your IDE or code coverage tool showing your project's code coverage. Include the screenshot in your git repo as a file named code-coverage.png.
   4. Show that all your unit tests pass. Take a screen shot of the JUnit tests in your IDE, showing the list of all unit tests and their results. Or copy the console output of your JUnit tests into a text file. Include the screen shot or text file in your git repo. Name the file test-results.png or test-results.txt.
   5. Mob with your teammates to refactor the Gilded Rose production code, removing as many code smells as possible, refactoring for clean code. Your refactored Gilded Rose production code should be short and concise. Commit your refactored code to your repo. To demonstrate that you worked as a mob, capture video of your session. Upload your video to YouTube. Document the URL of your video in your repo's README file.
   6. Mob with your teammates to add new features. Use TDD. Your test method(s) for the new inventory item, Conjured items, must start with the word “conjured”. You have at least one test method for Conjured items, and it proves that Conjured items degrade twice as fast as ordinary items. All tests should pass. To demonstrate that you worked as a mob, capture video of your session. Upload your video to YouTube. Document the URL of your video in your repo's README file.
